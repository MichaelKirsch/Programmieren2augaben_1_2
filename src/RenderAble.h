//derive from them will be compatible. So for example every class in a game eng√≠ne will need to be init, rendered,
//and updated from time to time. And to make sure that we can use those methods on all of our objects in our game we
//will make them derive from this base class. Virtual classes cant be created to objects, only derived classes can
